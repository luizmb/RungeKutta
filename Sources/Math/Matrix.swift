/// A row-major rectangular matrix over an ``ℝ`` scalar.
///
/// `Matrix` is the value-type carrier behind every linear-algebra operation in this
/// library — Birchall's scaling-and-squaring, Taylor expansions of `exp(A)`, and so on
/// rely on it. It stores its entries in a single contiguous `[Scalar]` row-major, so
/// `self[i, j]` reads as `storage[i * columns + j]`.
///
/// ## Why row-major?
///
/// Most introductory texts (Strang's *Introduction to Linear Algebra*, Trefethen &
/// Bau's *Numerical Linear Algebra*) write matrices as
/// `[[a_{1,1}, a_{1,2}, …], [a_{2,1}, …], …]` — a list of rows. Row-major storage
/// keeps that mental model: walking through `storage` walks across each row in turn.
/// (BLAS defaults to column-major, the Fortran convention; we deliberately don't,
/// to keep `subscript(i, j)` cache-friendly *and* visually consistent with how
/// matrices are taught.)
///
/// ## Mutation
///
/// `Matrix` is immutable. Use ``with(row:column:value:)`` to obtain a new matrix with
/// one entry changed. For bulk construction, build the `[Scalar]` storage first and
/// hand it to the initializer in one call — this matches how `Array` is conventionally
/// built before being wrapped in a value type.
