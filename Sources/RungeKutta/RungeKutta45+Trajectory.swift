    /// ## Why dense output?
    ///
    /// Adaptive RK45 picks the steps it likes for accuracy reasons; it doesn't
    /// land on any particular grid. Naively resampling its `(time, state)` pairs
    /// by nearest neighbour or linear interpolation leaks step-size error into
    /// the output. Dense output stores the slope at each segment endpoint and
    /// uses ``cubicHermite(at:on:)`` to evaluate the trajectory at any time
    /// between accepted samples — `C¹`-continuous, locally 4th-order accurate,
    /// and decoupled from the integrator's step choices.
    ///
    /// For the algorithm itself, see ``step(from:y:k1:size:derivative:)``.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - outputTimes: times at which to return state. Should be sorted
    ///     ascending. The integrator runs from `startingAt` to
    ///     `max(outputTimes)`. Times before `startingAt` return `initialState`;
    ///     times after the integrated range return the last computed state.
    ///     Empty input returns `[]`.
    ///   - initialState: `y(startingAt)`.
    ///   - derivative: `f(t, y)`. Required `@Sendable`.
    ///   - startingAt: `t₀` — the initial time. Defaults to `0`.
    ///   - tolerance: target infinity-norm of `y5 − y4` per step.
    ///   - initialStep: starting `h`. Defaults to `(t_end − startingAt) / 100`.
    ///   - minStep: smallest step the integrator will try before bailing.
    ///   - maxStep: largest step the integrator will take. Defaults to the
    ///     full span — let RK45 take big strides when the dynamics allow.
    ///   - maxIterations: safety bound on total accepted + rejected steps.
