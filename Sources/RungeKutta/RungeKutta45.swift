/// **Dormand–Prince 5(4)** embedded Runge–Kutta method — the standard adaptive
/// explicit RK pair used by SciPy's `RK45`, MATLAB's `ode45`, and most modern
/// non-stiff ODE solvers.
///
/// The method takes seven slope samples per step (`k1…k7`) and computes **two**
/// estimates from the same samples: a 5th-order accurate one and a 4th-order
/// accurate one. The difference between them estimates the local truncation
/// error; the step size is grown or shrunk to keep that error near the caller's
/// `tolerance`. Steps whose error exceeds the tolerance are rejected and
/// retried with a smaller step; steps whose error is well below it allow the
/// next step to grow.
///
/// **FSAL** (First-Same-As-Last): `k7` of an accepted step equals `k1` of the
/// next step, so we save one function evaluation per accepted step — six
/// evaluations on average, not seven.
///
/// ## When to use this
///
/// - **Use it** for smooth, non-stiff ODEs where you want automatic step
///   selection and don't want to hand-tune `RungeKutta4`'s fixed step.
/// - **Don't use it** for stiff systems (eigenvalues of the Jacobian differing
///   by many orders of magnitude — common in chemical kinetics, biokinetics
///   with fast / slow compartments). Explicit RK at any order needs tiny steps
///   for *stability*, not accuracy, on stiff problems. For those, an implicit
///   method (BDF / Gear, Radau-IIA, Rosenbrock) is the right tool.
/// - **Linear constant-coefficient** systems (e.g. ICRP biokinetic models)
///   have an analytic solution `y(t) = exp(A·t)·y₀` via the matrix exponential —
///   use ``Calculus/Taylor/exponential(of:tolerance:maxIterations:)`` or a
///   scaling-and-squaring variant. RK45 is overkill for those.
