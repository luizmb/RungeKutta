/// A numerical-differentiation method — *the recipe* for turning a function `f`
/// into an approximation of its `order`-th derivative `f^(order)`.
///
/// `DerivativeMethod` is a **witness** type: a struct that holds the deriving
/// function as a value, rather than a protocol or an enum-of-cases. That keeps
/// the type open for extension — anyone can write their own method by calling
/// `DerivativeMethod(order: …, deriving: …)` — while still letting the standard
/// methods live behind tidy namespaced factories like
/// `DerivativeMethod<Double>.CentralStencil.fivePoint(order: 2, step: .adaptative)`.
///
/// The wrapped closure is **pure**: given the same input `Fn`, it always returns
/// the same derivative `Fn`. The actual numerical work (multiple `f(x ± h)`
/// evaluations, weighted sum, division by a power of `h`) happens when the
/// returned `Fn` is called with a concrete `x`.
///
/// ## Namespaces
///
/// Standard methods live under five families (each is a `public enum` nested in
/// `DerivativeMethod`):
///
/// - ``CentralStencil`` — symmetric stencils centred on `x` (most accurate per
///   evaluation; needs `f` defined on both sides of `x`).
/// - ``ForwardStencil`` — one-sided stencils using `x, x+h, x+2h, …`. Use near a
///   left boundary of the domain.
/// - ``BackwardStencil`` — one-sided stencils using `x, x-h, x-2h, …`. Use near a
///   right boundary.
/// - ``Richardson`` — accuracy-boosting combinators that take an existing method
///   and produce a higher-order one by extrapolation.
/// - ``Compose`` — combinators that build new methods from existing ones
///   (e.g. ``Compose/repeated(_:times:)`` for naïve higher-order chains).
///
/// Plus ``custom(order:deriving:)`` as a raw escape hatch.
