    ///
    /// Compute terms incrementally using the recurrence `Tₖ = Tₖ₋₁ · A / k`:
    ///
    /// 1. Start with `sum = I`, `term = I`.
    /// 2. For `r = 1, 2, …`: set `term ← term · A / r`, then `sum ← sum + term`.
    /// 3. Stop when every entry of `|term / sum|` is below `tolerance`.
    ///
    /// The recurrence avoids recomputing factorials or matrix powers — just one matrix
    /// multiply per term.
    ///
    /// The convergence check uses `abs()` so series with negative-only entries (a
    /// single radioactive compartment, `A = [-λ]`) don't spuriously declare convergence
    /// after one term — a subtle bug present in some textbook implementations.
