/// Simpson's-rule weighted combination of four substep slopes:
/// `(k₁ + 2·k₂ + 2·k₃ + k₄) / 6`.
///
/// This is the **canonical RK4 weighting**. It coincides with Simpson's 1/3 rule for
/// numerical quadrature applied to the four slope estimates: weights `(1, 4, 1)/6`
/// across `(start, midpoint, end)`, where the middle slope is replaced by the average
/// of two midpoint estimates `(k₂ + k₃)/2`, giving the familiar `(1, 2, 2, 1)/6` pattern.
///
/// ### Where this comes from
///
/// Simpson's 1/3 rule for `∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx` approximates the integral by fitting a parabola
/// through `f(a)`, `f((a+b)/2)`, `f(b)` and integrating it exactly:
///
/// > `∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx ≈ ((b - a) / 6) · (f(a) + 4·f((a+b)/2) + f(b))`
///
/// In RK4 the four slopes (`k₁` start, `k₂` & `k₃` midpoint, `k₄` end) play the role of
/// `f(a)`, `f((a+b)/2)` (estimated twice for stability), and `f(b)`. Substituting:
///
/// > `(k₁ + 4·((k₂ + k₃)/2) + k₄) / 6  =  (k₁ + 2·k₂ + 2·k₃ + k₄) / 6`
///
/// The "4" of Simpson's rule becomes "2·k₂ + 2·k₃" — same constant, split across two
/// midpoint estimates. This is why RK4 is fourth-order accurate: it's effectively
/// applying Simpson's rule to the velocity field over each step.

/// ### Generic over `VectorState`
///
/// Works equally for scalar `T: ℝ` (because every concrete real number conforms to
/// ``VectorState`` with `Scalar == Self`) and for vector states like `[Double]`. The
/// scalar and vector RK4 solvers in ``RungeKutta4`` both delegate to this function —
/// the algorithmic concept is identical, only the type of `k` differs.
